/* Async JavaScript 
Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once the task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

ex: setTimeout(()=>{},delay)
The delay specified here is the minimum delay, the actual delay may be longer than intended.
If delay is omitted, a value of 0 is used, meaning execute immediately, or more accurately, the next event cycle.
